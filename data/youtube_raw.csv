I was watching your gitlab masterclass video on youtube within the time frame of 5:28 sec I found 2 mistakes

1st is CICD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) difference between deployment and delivery is for delivery it require some manual intervention  i.e (approval) before deploying on production

2nd is while explaining details about free subscription in pricing you said 100GB transfer per month actually it is 10GB transfer per month

I am sorry to say that I am not an expert but still I can see and understand
