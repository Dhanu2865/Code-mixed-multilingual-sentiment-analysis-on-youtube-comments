I was watching your gitlab masterclass video on youtube within the time frame of 5:28 sec I found 2 mistakes

1st is CICD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) difference between deployment and delivery is for delivery it require some manual intervention  i.e (approval) before deploying on production

2nd is while explaining details about free subscription in pricing you said 100GB transfer per month actually it is 10GB transfer per month

I am sorry to say that I am not an expert but still I can see and understand

LGLuHYHbCFA,@ravi9592,"Extremely very useful for someone who doesn't know the basics. One of the very good informative video which i seen in recent days.

Very minor points.
1. After git init, if we want to see the files, we can click on show hidden files. Then we can see then them in windows.
2. Using Vs Code Terminal instead of command line might be better choice as we can see branches are switching right after checkout command. So that no need to switch between CMD and VS Code.",2025-02-27T07:20:24Z,1,neutral,toxic,spam,,,1,0
